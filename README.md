# Netflix Clone
Just a simple coding exercise mimicking Netflix interface. I may have or may not borrowed some ideas from other streaming services. ðŸ˜…

I randomly generate the list of show in the bottom galleries using Promises and then applying the OwnCarousel jQuery plugin. Some duplicates will probably appear, but that's OK for the purpose of the project.

Note: This was made as part of the LocalizaLabs React Developer bootcamp by Digital Innovation One.

# Netflix Clone
Just a simple coding exercise mimicking Netflix interface. I may have or may not borrowed some ideas from other streaming services. 😅

I randomly generate the list of shows in the bottom galleries using Promises before applying the Owl Carousel jQuery plugin. Some duplicates will probably appear, but that's OK for the purpose of the project.

This mockup is a static page. To run it, just save to your computer and open in your browser.

Note: This was made as part of the LocalizaLabs React Developer bootcamp by Digital Innovation One.
